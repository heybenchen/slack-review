## Installation
* Set up an [incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) on your Slack account and grab the API key
* Load this into `chrome://extensions/` using *"Load Unpacked Extension"*
* Enter in your webhook URL through the extension options page in Chrome

## A note on security
This extension stores your incoming webhook URL locally, so it's only as your Chrome install.

## Credits
* [https://github.com/robjmills/slacklink](https://github.com/robjmills/slacklink) for being the basis of this
